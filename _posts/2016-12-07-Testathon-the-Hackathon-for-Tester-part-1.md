Testing have many different standard also testing have many different type, so far the Assessment Testing that I know is like UAT ( User Assessment Testing ) and SAT ( Security Assesment Testing ) -> this shown much controversy many alterntive name is Site Assesment Test, System Assessment Test in this case I will user Security.

Grown technology made a born of another type of assessment, from UAT born UI Testing, UX Testing, Input Testing, etc from SAT born Penetration Testing, Hacker Testing, etc. So after born of the different, shown *Bug Bounty* the system of testing which be payed by every bug located, doesn't matter about UAT nor SAT.

The interisting about this event is tester just do as they like, no matter about classified bug. In the past I did a testing famous apps (lets call it TP) they didn't announce about which bug should us test, so people comes testing the apps, some people report about security bug and the other. But TP never announce about security bug, they said that bug isn't even valid. Dude my friend show me the bug and he found it about critical bug, and they just ignore it. Worst fact, 1 week later they fix the bug. DOUCHE!
