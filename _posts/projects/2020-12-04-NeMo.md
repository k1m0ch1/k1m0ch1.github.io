The origin repo is here https://github.com/eFishery/NeMo, so the story behind this project is I made some challenge to my product team that we could raise the count of online user using the online platform, is kinda like how to convert from offline user to online user so we didn't need a person to sale the product.

Now the problem is fish farmer is using the online platform only for communication and entertainment, and obviously they are often using facebook and whatsapp, but some farmer they are using "google" to search the problem with their farming.

So at this moment, we want to know "what if, we make the whatsapp as our platform to convert offline user to online platform", so that is how NeMo come.

NeMo is Customizeable Whatsapp chatbot with simply creating a YML file to configure the bot, very easy to configure.

Why you need this ? imagine you want to automate your shop order or catalog your shop, or just simply don't want to reply some annoying friend

This tools is the study case research from the eFishery to solve problem "How might we gather data supply from farmer it self" so we create a bot whatsapp because farmer is very familiar with whatsapp and facebook rather than with new apps

now Why I named it NeMo ? you know clown fish right, the movie nemo ? yes it is inspired from there, so the nemo is bot and coral is the configuration for the bot, yea right, its lame i know.

So you will imagine how this will working right, You need to test the NeMo is connected with your device and then you create the YAML file as the Bot Configuration and then test the bot by triggering the bot from the keyword registered at configuration, the configuration is called coral, you can learn about the coral configuration in here Understanding Coral Configuration

NeMo is using the reverse engineered whatsapp web from here sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng, this is the only reason why the requirement need the screen is stay awake and focus on whatsapp application, we are using Rhymen/go-whatsapp for the golang library

Nemo is also using the randomizer pause chat depends on how many word is typed, its like how typical human type the word 1-3 secon perword, also NeMo will sent the "typing" mode so the whatsapp will thinking that we are as the person
