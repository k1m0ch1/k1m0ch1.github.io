The project is actually inspired by @resir014 at twitter, he told me to inspire the "code" community we could start by streaming, he call this Twitch Driven Development, and this is my very first time making a twitch channel caode something and my follower on twitter getting bigger.

The Project is pretty simple, by using the python I'm scapping alfamart, indomaret and yogya to scrap all the price, in order to understand about the data prediction, so I'm just waiting for a whole year to make this, but unfortunetly my server can't handle this, so I'm abandon this for exact 8 month running.

Project is actually pretty good in the begining, it will send an update of every item on conveience store that change and how much it is change, and the problem is ALL the item is actually change everyday, I'm also making this into youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIBlln2AO9I, and that is also my very first video on youtube.

The bot will be notified to twitter and save all the data in json format

Here is the project: https://github.com/k1m0ch1/BiBiT

the project takes a different people interest, and some of my friend interest this to evolve into proper project, here is some of the talk https://twitter.com/BukanYahya/status/1337776445804879872 and it begin to bring other friend interest https://twitter.com/BukanYahya/status/1340320438019215363. 

But the project is discontinued due to our very busy day and we can't keep up to make the product.
