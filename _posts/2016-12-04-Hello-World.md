When epicurus said about the three way of happines about to _culture_ mind rather than having a view of scenery to entertain mind, its succesfully change my mind about having a refreshment. The way to clear your mind, to release the distress of your mind, to get out the harsness of daily life only with culturing your mind.

There is many ways of culturing your mind, writing, reading, learning. So I start this blog because I will reduce my worthless daily activity with culturing my mind.
