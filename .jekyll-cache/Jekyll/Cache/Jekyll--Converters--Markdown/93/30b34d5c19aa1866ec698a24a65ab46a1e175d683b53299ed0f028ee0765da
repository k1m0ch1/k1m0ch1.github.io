I"c<p>About 5 months break from writing some blog I have so many jobs penetration testing and the timeline is really short, so I don’t have any time to update my blog. About 5 project for every months I have to finish all the penetration testing in short time, so many bug I found and so many reckless in such a big infrastructure. Because of many bugs found by the reckless of developer, now I have planning for making a developer security guidelines.</p>

<p>I’m about researching this for a week, so many practical to use about developer guideines. My goal to build this developer security guidelines is to make a best practise use security in application or developer environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“More Secure the apps is, more hard user to use it”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which mean lead to raise of hard development, because developer need to follow the security standard to build the apps.</p>

<p>The very basic idea I build this guidelines is, to understand and help developer to build the high security standard without makes the development process delayed and easy with appliance this guidelines.</p>
