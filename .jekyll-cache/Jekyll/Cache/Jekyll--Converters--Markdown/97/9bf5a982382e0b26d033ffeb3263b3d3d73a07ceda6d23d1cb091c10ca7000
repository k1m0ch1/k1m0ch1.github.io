I"~<p>When epicurus said about the three way of happines about to <em>culture</em> mind rather than having a view of scenery to entertain mind, its succesfully change my mind about having a refreshment. The way to clear your mind, to release the distress of your mind, to get out the harsness of daily life only with culturing your mind.</p>

<p>There is many ways of culturing your mind, writing, reading, learning. So I start this blog because I will reduce my worthless daily activity with culturing my mind.</p>
