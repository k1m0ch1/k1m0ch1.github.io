> a Hackathon for Tester

"is that even real?" my mind slip in and start to research about Testathon. Firstly I was goes on the link they was refference on email.
"this is real" said my mind when I visit the site of Testathon, carefully I read about testathon and its chill me up its exist also it will come into my city. So all a day along I start to research what should I need to prepare before it comes.

Testathon or we can call it Hackathon for Tester, is some kind of event for tester to do their passion on apps/web. The main event Testathon of course to gather all computer tester and share our kind for a day or even for a several days. I was have a bad memmory about apps tester, so i was got invited into bug bount of famous apps in indonesia lets call it TP. in short conclusion they made a rule that really invisible, I found many bugs of security also I report it, but they never agree about the bugs its not in the rule "they said" typically it suppose to be legal right. The most terrible things is they PATCH it.

so lets continue
> Testathon is an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming
